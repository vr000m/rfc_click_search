My first chrome extension.

I often find myself reading RFCs or drafts and sometimes they are not the
https://tools.ietf.org/html version. This plugin basically converts the URL
to the tools URL. If you select text which is of type "RFC XXXX" or
"draft-*" and click the extension then it will send the selected string to
the IETF backend and will try to find the document. If the document is
found, it will open the link in another browser tab.
